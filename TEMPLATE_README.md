# Initial setup for template app

When you use the architecture template, you should adapt the template to the project that the template will be used for.
To setup the project please run the **`./setup.sh`** script which will guide you through the **setup process**:
1. Project cleanup
2. App package name selection
3. App name selection
4. Committing setup changes to Git

**Note**: The changes of the script cannot be reversed if Git is not set up before running the script.
The changes include:
- rename package name
- rename app name
- remove all the setup scripts

### **Remove this script when finished with all the steps of the setup**
